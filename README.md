# Card Game War

This program is a card game called "War".

I coeded with a book "The self taught programmer".



This game is played by two people and each player turns up a card from the deck at the same time. 
Then, the one who has a higher card takes both the cards and puts them back of the bottom of the stack.

During the game, if the cards are the same rank, the one who has a higher suit wins. 
The strongest suit is "spades", then  "hearts", "diamonds", "clubs". 

The game ends when one of the players takes all the cards from the others.
